• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
• Why should you have different branches?
• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?



1)Gitignore file maintains the list of files or their extensions which are to be omitted by git when performing a commit. In case of a java project it includes .class, .jar, .war, .ear and .nar files.

2)In the case where the merged branch has more commits than the checkout branch the checkout branch is fast forwarded without any additional commits.

3)Maintaing different branches is advisable to avoid any damages to the master code . This comes handy in case of multiple users.

4)Usually there is a single repository for a project.
